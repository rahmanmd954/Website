This program is currently a work in progress, which will eventually become a chrome extention. 
 
The program will allow students to enter the unique id of classes and track for status changes, to help check if a class a student is watching has opened up or been waitliested, etc.  
  
The program is still in it's early stages, so please excuse any bugs.
